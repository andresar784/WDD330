        <h2>Week 3 Notes</2>
        <h3>Objects</h3>
        <p>An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions.</p> 
        <p>If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a method. One way to think about an object is that it’s 
        like a dictionary where you look up a property name and see a value</p>
        <p>You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation,also using bracket notation</p>
        <p>Dot notation is much more common</p>
        <p>To call an object’s method we can also use dot or bracket notation.
         Calling a method is the same as invoking a function, so parentheses need to be placed after the method name</p>
        <p>An object literal can be passed as a parameter to a function. This is useful when there are a large number
             of parameters, as it allows the arguments to be provided by name and in any order. 
             This means you don't have to remember the order to enter them when invoking a function</p>
        <h6>this</h6>
        <p>The keyword this refers to the object that it is within.
             It can be used inside methods to gain access to the object’s properties.</p>
        <h6>The Math Object</h6>
        <p>The Math object is a built-in object that has several properties representing mathematical constants, 
            as well as methods that carry out a number of common mathematical operations.
            All the properties and methods of the Math object are immutable and unable to be changed.</p>
        <h6>The Date Object</h6>
        <p>Date objects contain information about dates and times. Each object represents a single moment in time.</p>
        <p>It contains very useful methods to access the info presented</p>
        <h6>The RegExp Object</h6>
        <p>A regular expression (or RegExp, for short) is a pattern that can be used to search strings
             for matches to the pattern. A common use is 'find and replace' type operations. </p>
        <h3>The Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable
         interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order,
          content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.</p>
        <p>The DOM provides several methods that allow us to access any element on a page. 
            These methods will return a node object or a node list, which is an array-like object. 
            These objects can then be assigned to a variable and be inspected or modified.</p>
        <h6>Getting An Element By Its ID</h6>
        <p>We use the getElementById() to access to the properties of the element</p>
        <h6>Get Elements By Their Tag Name</h6>
        <p>getElementsByTagName() will return a live node list of all the elements with the tag 
            name that is provided as an argument.</p>
        <h6>Get Elements By Their Class Name</h6>
        <p>getElementsByClassName() will return a live node list of all elements that 
            have the class name that is supplied as an argument</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Exercise to demonstrate the use of the DOM model.</h3>
        <p>I used this example to demonstrate the .addEventListener method of the DOM.</p>
        <p>It demonstrate the usefullnes because we can "uses a non-blocking approach 
            that uses event </p>
        <p>listeners to listen out for any clicks on the page. 
           Every time the page is clicked, a callback function will</p>
        <p> be called. So the program can continue processing the rest of the code while it's 
            waiting for the click event to happen."(O'Reilly)</p>
        <p>It also demonstrate the usage of the <em>Date object</em></p>
        <p>I used some of the methods od the Date Object and played around it, I submited just the:</p>
        <p>toDateString() method, but some others methods are available.</p>
        <p>I tested with some mouse events like: click, mouseover and mouseout.</p>
        <p id='timetest'>Here the time will be changed..</p>
