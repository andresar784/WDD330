        <h3>Testing and debugging</h3>
        <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program.</p>
        <p>They are caused by some of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external 
                devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
            <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or 
                faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo. </li>
            <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which 
                the program is unable to handle.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Exceptions.</h5>
        <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the erro</p>
        <p><em>Stack Traces.</em> An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</p>
        <p><em>Warnings</em>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning.</p>
