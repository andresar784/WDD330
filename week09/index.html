        <h3>The Window Object </h3>
        <p>The window object, represents the browser window that contains a web page.</p>
        <h5>The Browser Object Model</h5>
        <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties
             and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.</p>
        <p>Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.</p>
        <p>In a browser environment, the global object is the window object.
             This means that any global variable created is actually a property of the window object.
        </p>
        <h6>Dialogs</h6>
        <p>There are some functions that produce dialogs in the window, there are: <em> alert(), confirm() and prompt().</em></p>
        <p>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box</p>
        <button class="btn btn-danger"  onclick="myFunction()">Press here to see a an alert</button>
        <p></p>
        <p>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that
             shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel.</p>
        <button class="btn btn-success"  onclick="myFunction1()">Press here to see a confirm dialog</button>
        <p></p>
        <p>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that 
            allows the user to enter text. This text is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK</p>
        <button class="btn btn-info"  onclick="myFunction2()">Press here to see a prompt dialog</button>
        <P></P>
        <p id="demo"></p>
        <h5>Browser Information</h5>
        <p>The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the user’s browser.</p>
        <h6>Browser</h6>
        <p>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used.
             Its userAgent property will return information about the browser and operating system being used</p>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="myFunction3()">The language of your browser is.. </button>
        <p></p>
        <p id="demo1"></p>
        <h6>Location, Location, Location</h6>
        <p>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page</p>
        <p>It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.</p>
        <p>The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used 
            (such as http, https, pop2, ftp etc.). Note that there is a colon (:) at the end</p>
        <p>The host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number (this is often omitted if the default port 80 is used</p>
        <p>The hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL:</p>
        <p>The port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL</p>
        <p>The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain</p>
        <p>The search property returns a string that starts with a '?' followed by the query string parameters. It returns an empty string if there are no query string parameters</p>
        <p>The hash property returns a string that starts with a "#" followed by the fragment identifier.</p>
        <p>The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from. </p>
        <button class="btn btn-success" onclick="myFunction4()">Some uses of the location property</button>
        <p></p>
        <p id="demo2"></p>
        <h6>The browser history</h6>
        <p>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session</p>
       <p> The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page</p>
       <p>The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page</p>
       <p>There are also the window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods that can be used to navigate forwards and backwards by one page respectively,
            just like using the browser’s forward and back buttons.</p>
        <button class="btn btn-info"onclick=myFunction5()>History usage..</button>
        <p></p>
        <p id="demo3"></p>
        <h6>Controlling Windows</h6>
        <p>A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes the URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, 
            the window title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third parameter.</p>
        <button class="btn btn-danger"onclick=myFunction6()>A new windows, enjoy..</button>
        <p id="demo4"></p>
        <p>Other useful methods are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The close() method can be used to close a window.</li>
            <li>Is also possible to move a window using the window.moveTo() method. This takes two parameters that are the X and Y coordinates of the screen that the window is to be moved to</li>
            <li>You can resize a window using the window.resizeTo() method. This takes two parameters that specify the width and height of the resized window’s dimensions</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Screen Information</h6>
        <p>The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on.</p>
        <p>You can find out the height and width of the screen in pixels using the height and width properties respectively</p>
        <p>The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and width of the screen, excluding any operating system menus</p>
        <p>The colorDepth property can be used to find the color bit depth of the user’s monitor.</p>
        <button class="btn btn-success" onclick=myFunction7()>Do you know about your screen information?</button>
        <p></p>
        <p id="demo5"></p>    
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <h3>The Document Object</h3>
        <p>Each window object contains a document object. 
            This object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.</p>
        <h5>document.write()</h5>
        <p>The write() method simply writes a string of text to the page.</p>
        <p>The document.write() method can also be used within a document inside script tags to inject a string into the markup. 
        This will not overwrite the rest of the HTML on the page.</p>
        <h5>Cookies</h5>
        <p>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer.</p>
        <p>Cookies can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping cart), authentication and tracking users.</p> 
        <p>Cookies take the form of a text file that contain a list of name/value pairs separated by semicolons. </p>
        <button class="btn btn-warning" onclick=checkCookie()>Cookies in action..</button>
        <p></p>
        <p>Please, reload the page and click in the button to see the cookie in action</p>
        <h5>Timing Functions</h5>
        <h6>setTimeout()</h6>
        <p>The window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function, 
            and for repeatedly executing functions at regular intervals</p>
        <p>The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a 
            number of milliseconds as its second parameter. Try entering the following example into a console.</p>
        <h6>setInterval()</h6>
        <p>The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout(), except that it will 
            repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</p>
        <h6>Animation</h6>
        <p>The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page.</p>
        <p>An example of a animation..</p>
        <p></p>
        <div id='square'></div>
        <h6>requestAnimationFrame</h6>
        <p>This method of the window object works in much the same way as the window.setInterval() method, 
            although it has a number of improvements to optimize its performance. These include making the most of the browser’s built-in graphics-handling capabilities, and not running the animation when the tab is inactive, resulting in a much smoother performance.</p>
       <div id='square1'></div>
       <p>The second example runs smoother.</p>
