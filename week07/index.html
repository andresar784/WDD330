    <h3>Week 07 Notes</h3>
    <h4>Further Functions</h4>
    <h5>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</h5>
    <p>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, 
        and even redefine itself. This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has 
        the same name as the function.</p>   
    <p>If the function is also assigned to another variable, this variable will maintain the original function definition and not be rewritten. This is because the original function 
        is assigned to a variable, then within the function, a variable with the same name as the function is assigned to a different function.</p>  
    <h5>Recursive Functions</h5>
    <p>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met.
         It’s a useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved.</p>  
    <h5>Callbacks</h5>
    <p>They’re functions passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to.</p>  
    <p>JavaScript is a single-threaded environment, which means only one piece of code will ever be processed at a time. This may seem like a limitation, but non-blocking techniques
         can be used to ensure that the program continues to run.      
         </p> 
    <h5>Generalized Function</h5> 
    <p>Callbacks can be used to build more generalized functions. Instead of having lots of specific functions, one function can be written that accepts a callback</p>  
    
    <h3>Ajax</h3>
    <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages 
        without reloading. This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated 
        in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.<p>
    <p>Ajax was a neat acronym that referred to the different parts of the process being used: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Asynchronous.</em> When a request for data is sent, the program doesn’t have to stop and wait for the response. 
            It can carry on running, waiting for an event to fire when a response is received. By using callbacks to manage this, programs are able to run in an efficient way, avoiding lag as data is transferred back and forth.
            JavaScript</li>
        <li><em>JavaScript.</em> JavaScript was always considered a 'front-end' language, not used to communicate with the server. Ajax enabled JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a server,
             allowing content to be updated in real time.</li>
        <li><em>XML.</em> When the term Ajax was originally coined, XML documents were often used to return data. 
            Many different types of data can be sent, but by far the most commonly used in Ajax nowadays is JSON, 
            which is more lightweight and easier to parse than XML.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>API's</h5>
    <p>An application programming interface (API) is a collection of methods that allows external access to another program or service. Many websites allow controlled access to their data via public APIs.
         This means that developers are able to interact with the data and create mashups of third-party services.</p>
    <h5>The Fetch API.</h5>
    <p>It has since been superseded by the Fetch API, which is currently a living standard for requesting and sending data asynchronously across a network. The Fetch API uses promises to avoid callback hell, 
        and also streamlines a number of concepts that had become cumbersome when using the XMLHttpRequest object.</p>  
    <p>The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only  one <em> mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch.</em></p>  
    <p>The Fetch API introduced the Response interface that deals with the object that’s returned when the promise is fulfilled.
         Response objects have a number of properties and methods that allow us to process the response effectively.</p>  
    <p>The redirect() method can be used to redirect to another URL. It creates a new promise that resolves to the response from the redirected URL.</p>  
    <p>The text() method takes a stream of text from the response, reads it to completion and then returns a promise that resolves to a USVSting object that can be treated as a string in JavaScript.</p>  
    <p>JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. The json() method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object. </p>
