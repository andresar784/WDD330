        <h2>Week 4 Notes</2>
        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <p>Forms are made up of a form element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons.</p>
        <p>The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup</p>
        <p>Form properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically. A form can be submitted manually by the user employing a button or input element with a type attribute of submit, or even an input element with a type attribute of image:</li>
            <li>The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.</li>
            <li>The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Form Events</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The focus event occurs when an element is focused on.</li>
            <li>The blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.</li>
            <li>The change event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Submitting a Form.</p>
        <p>Possibly the most important form event is the submit event, occurring when the form is submitted.</p>
       `<p>Form Controls:</p>
        
       <ul>
           <li>Inputs fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads</li>
           <li>select menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
           <li>textarea elements for longer text entry</li>
           <li>button elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Form Validation:</p>
       <p>Form validation is the process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly</p>
       <ul>
           <li>A required field is completed</li>
           <li>An email address is valid</li>
           <li>A number is entered when numerical data is required</li>
           <li>A password is at least a minimum number of characters</li>
       </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>OOP</h3>
        <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods</p>
        <p>Encapsulation</p>
        <p>In OOP, this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it’s done.</p>
        <p>Polymorphism</p>
        <p> In OOP, this means various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p>
        <p>Inheritance</p>
        <p>In OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</p>
        <p>Classes</p>
        <p>A class to define a blueprint for an object. Objects are then created as an instance of that class, and inherit all the properties and methods of the class</p>

        <h3>The tic tac toe game</h3>
        <p>The tictactoe game is widely used to show how to use javascript as a very powerfull programing language</p>
        <p>I see many Youtube tutorials and I choose to follow this <a href="https://dev.to/bornasepic/pure-and-simple-tic-tac-toe-with-javascript-4pgn" target="_blank">example</a>
        to understand how it works. I also have some bugs that I will be able to solve using the console.
        It was fun because I was able to deepen my understanding about how we can debug using the
        browser.</p>
        <p>The button below also use a form</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <form action="tictactoe.html">
            <input  type="submit" value="Tic tac toe, Have fun!" />
        </form>
    </div>
