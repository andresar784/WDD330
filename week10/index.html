        <h3>Week 10 Notes</h3>
        <h4>Client-side form validation</h4>
        <p>Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called client-side form validation, 
            and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls</p>
        <p>Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; 
            by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away.</p>
            <p> When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the 
                correct format and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, 
                while validation done on the server is called server-side validation</p>
            <p>If the information is correctly formatted, the application allows the data to be submitted to the server and (usually) saved in a database; if the information 
                isn't correctly formatted, it gives the user an error message explaining what needs to be corrected, and lets them try again.</p>
            <p>We want to make filling out web forms as easy as possible. So why do we insist on validating our forms? There are three main reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>We want to get the right data, in the right format.</b> Our applications won't work properly if our users' data is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.</li>
                <li><b>We want to protect our users' data.</b> Forcing our users to enter secure passwords makes it easier to protect their account information.</li>
                <li><b>We want to protect ourselves.</b> There are many ways that malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application.</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Using built-in form validation</h5>
        <p>Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features, which we've discussed in many places throughout this module. This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. 
            Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.</p>
        <p>One of the most significant features of HTML5 form controls is the ability to validate most user data without relying on JavaScript.
             This is done by using validation attributes on form elements</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b><em>required: </em></b> Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.</li>
            <li><b><em>minlength</em></b> and <b><em>maxlength:</em></b> Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings).</li>
            <li><b><em>min</em></b> and <b><em> max: </em></b> Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types.</li>
            <li><b><em>type: </em></b>Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type.</li>
            <li><b><em>pattern: </em></b> Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When an element is valid, the following thing are true: </p>
        <p>The element matches the :valid CSS pseudo-class, which lets you apply a specific style to valid elements.</p>
        <p>When an element is invalid, the followinf thing are true: </p>
        <p>The element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class, and sometimes other UI pseudo-classes (e.g., :out-of-range)
             depending on the error, which lets you apply a specific style to invalid elements.</p>
        <h6>Some examples.</h6>
        <form>
            <label >Would you prefer meat or fish?</label>
            <input  required pattern="[mM]eat|[Ff]ish">
            <button>Submit</button>
          </form>
          <h6>This example used:</h6>
          <p>Required, The simplest HTML5 validation feature is the required attribute. To make an input mandatory, 
              add this attribute to the element. When this attribute is set, the element matches the :required UI 
              pseudo-class and the form won't submit, displaying an error message on submission when the input is empty. 
              While empty, the input will also be considered invalid, matching the :invalid UI pseudo-class.</p>
        <p>A regular expression, Another useful validation feature is the pattern attribute, which expects a Regular Expression as its value. A regular expression (regex) is a pattern that can be used to
             match character combinations in text strings, so regexps are ideal for form validation and serve a variety of 
             other uses in JavaScript.</p>
             <form>
            <label>Enter a word of minimum of 6 letters and maximum of 8..</label>
            <input type="text" minlength="6" maxlength="8">
        </form>
        <h6>This example used:</h6>
        <p>minlength. The minlength attribute defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into an input or textarea. 
            This must be an integer value 0 or higher.
             If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length.</p>
        <p>maxlength. The maxlength attribute defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into an input or textarea. This must be an integer v
            alue 0 or higher.Any maxlength value must be greater than or equal to the value of minlength, if present and valid. 
            The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text value of the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. 
            Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.</p> 
            <label for="number">How many would you like?</label>
            <input type="number" value="1" min="1" max="10">
            <h6>This example used:</h6>
            <p>For number fields (i.e. input type="number"), the min and max attributes
                 can be used to provide a range of valid values. If the field contains a value outside this range, it will be invalid.</p> 
            <p>Entered numbers outside this range will show as invalid; users won't be able to use the increment/decrement arrows to move the value outside of this range. If the user manually enters a number outside of this range,
                 the data is invalid. The number is not required, so removing the value will still result in a valid value.</p>        
        <h5>Validating forms using JavaScript</h5>        
         <p>You must use JavaScript if you want to take control over the look and feel of native error messages or to deal with 
             legacy browsers that do not support HTML's built-in form validation.</p>
